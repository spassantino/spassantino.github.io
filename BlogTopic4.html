<Title>What is ‘void’ in a method declaration? How does this 
differ from declaring a method with a return type?</Title>
<p>A method returns to the code that invoked it when it completes all the statements in the method,
reaches a return statement, or throws an exception, whichever occurs first.
You declare a method's return type in its method declaration. Within the body of the method, 
you use the return statement to return the value.
Any method declared void doesn't return a value. It does not need to contain a return 
statement, but it may do so. In such a case, a return statement can be used to branch 
out of a control flow block and exit the method </p>
