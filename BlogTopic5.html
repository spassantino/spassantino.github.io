<h5>Blog Topic 5 Working Through Java the Hard Way:</h5>
<Title>When it comes to methods, what is the difference between a “parameter” and an “argument”? 
Is there one? When would you use one versus the other?</Title>
<p>A parameter is a variable in a method definition; the things in the method's signature 
that indicate what the method must receive when it's invoked. When a method is called, the arguments 
are the data you pass into the method's parameters. Parameter is variable in the declaration of function. 
Argument is the actual value of this variable that gets passed to function; 
the things you specify between the parentheses when you're invoking a method</p>
