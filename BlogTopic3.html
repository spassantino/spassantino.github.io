<h5>Blog Topic 3 Working Through Java the Hard Way:</h5>
<title>What is the difference between a ‘for’, ‘while’ and ‘do while’ loop? </title>
<p>The 'for' statement is a statement that repeatedly loops <i>until</i> a particular condition is satisfied. 
The initialization expression initializes the loop, it's executed once, as the loop begins. 
When the termination expression evaluates to false, the loop terminates. 
The increment expression is invoked after each iteration through the loop. The 'for' loop is best for 
loops with a set number of interations; e.g. you know you're going to loop 100 times, 
or where the change to the index is constant; e.g. plus one or minus one to my counter every iteration. </p>
<p>'For loops' allow you to run through the loop when you know how many times you need 
it to run through the program, and continually increases until the condition returns false.</p>
<p>The 'while' statement continually executes a block of statements <i>while</i> a particular condition is true.
'While' loops evaluate expression, which must return a boolean value. 
If the expression evaluates to true, the 'while' statement executes the statement in the 'while' block. 
The while loop is best for an undetermined number of interations ("keep doing something until this happens").
The advantage to a while loop is that it will repeat as often as necessary to accomplish its goal.</p>
<p>The 'do-while' loop executes the body of the loop at least once even if the condition is false at the first attempt.</p>
<p>The difference between 'do-while' and 'while' is that 'do-while' evaluates its expression 
at the bottom of the loop instead of the top. Therefore, the statements within the do 
block are always executed at least once. In a do-while loop, the control first reaches to 
the statement in the body of a do-while loop. The statements in the body get executed first 
and then the control reaches to the condition part of the loop. The condition is verified and, 
if it is true, the loop is iterated again, and if the condition is false, then the control resumes 
to the next line immediate after the loop.</p>
