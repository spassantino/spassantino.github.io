<h5>Blog Topic 1 Working Through Java the Hard Way:</h5>
<title>What is the difference between ‘switch’ and ‘if/else’?</title>
<p>"Exercise 22: Making Decisions with a Big Switch" of <i>Learning Java the Hard Way</i>
introduced the 'switch' statement as a command for the computer 
to find the current value of the variable within the parentheses against a list of values.
The computer searches the list of cases for a match, then moves to the right side,
and begins running code until it is stopped by a break. 
The 'switch' statement has the option of containing a default statement. 
Its statements are executed only if none of the previous case constants match the switch expression.
</p> An 'if' statement can prompt the computer to select between two alternatives,
 utilizing a boolean expression to select which correct alternative to execute.
If the boolean expression is true, then the 'if' code will be executed. 
The 'if' statement may be followed by an optional else statement 
 to be executed when the boolean expression is false.

<title>When would you use one versus the other?</title>
<p> Deciding on whether to use a 'string' statement versus an 'if/else' statement 
depends on a few factors, primarily which expression is tested in your statement.
'If/else' statements can test expressions based on ranges of values or conditions, 
whereas a 'switch' statement tests expressions based only on a single integer, 
enumerated value, or String object. 'Switch' statements allow for fall-through, 
which in exercise 22, coded the program to figure out the number of days in a month.
