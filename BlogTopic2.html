<title>When would you use ‘=’ vs ‘==’ vs ‘.equals’?
Explain what each of these does and in which cases you should use them.</title>
<p>Although similar in appearance, in Java '=', '==' and '.equals' have separate meaning.</p>
<p>'=' is the simple assignment operator; it assigns the value on its right to the operand on its left.</p>
<p>'==' checks to see whether the value of two operands are equal or not, 
if values are not equal then condition becomes true. '==' is used to compare primitive data types and objects.</p>
<p> '.equals', like '==' is also used to compare objects to check equality however 
'.equals' is a method whereas '==' is an operator. '.equals' is used to compare Strings.</p>
